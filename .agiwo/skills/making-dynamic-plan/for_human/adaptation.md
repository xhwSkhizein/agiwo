# Adaptation: For Human Plans

After completing the three core engines (Diagnose → Structure → Evolve), apply these human-facing adaptations before delivering the plan.

## Audience Style Matching

Tailor the plan's **format and language** to the audience's cognitive style:

| Audience style | Format preference | Language style |
|----------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Analytical (engineers, finance) | Data tables, logic chains, causal diagrams | Precise, quantified, evidence-based |
| Conceptual (creatives, strategists) | Vision narratives, possibility maps, analogies | Inspiring, big-picture, future-oriented |
| Structural (ops, admin) | Checklists, flowcharts, SOPs, Gantt charts | Step-by-step, procedural, unambiguous |
| Social (sales, HR, leadership) | Role descriptions, interaction maps, impact stories | People-centered, relational, motivational |

**How to detect style**: infer from the user's role, how they describe the problem (data-heavy vs narrative vs process-oriented), and what format they naturally gravitate toward. When uncertain, ask: "Would you prefer a detailed breakdown or a high-level overview?"

The same plan core can be presented in different formats. Choose the one that resonates.

## Granting Autonomy

People commit more to plans they co-create. Even when the destination is fixed, leave flexibility on:

- **Path**: multiple valid approaches → let executor choose
- **Pace**: suggest cadence, don't mandate rigid timelines unless hard deadlines exist
- **Resource allocation**: provide budget/resource envelope, let executor decide distribution

Minimum participation: let the executor estimate task durations and confirm milestones. This transforms "assigned work" into "owned work."

## Meaning Framing

Reframe tasks in terms of **role and impact**, not just deliverables:

| Instead of | Frame as |
|------------|----------|
| "Write the API docs" | "As the API owner, ensure every consumer can integrate in <30 min" |
| "Fix the onboarding flow" | "You're shaping the first 5 minutes of every new user's experience" |
| "Run the migration script" | "You're safeguarding 3 years of customer data during the transition" |

Make the connection between individual tasks and end-user impact explicit in the plan.

## Interaction Pattern

When helping a human plan, follow this conversation flow:

1. **Listen first**: let the user describe the situation fully before diagnosing
2. **Reflect back**: summarize your understanding and the diagnosed uncertainty level — get confirmation
3. **Co-build PSA**: propose P/S/A, invite corrections
4. **Present draft plan**: deliver a structured plan using the appropriate template
5. **Invite refinement**: "What would you adjust? Any constraints I missed?"
6. **Embed ownership**: ensure the user sees themselves in the plan, not just tasks assigned to them
